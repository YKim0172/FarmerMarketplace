# Who are we?
Hello! We are Yu Hyun Kim and Will Irvin, first-year Computer Science majors attending Purdue University West Lafayette. We have developed our project "Farmer's Marketplace" in response to John Deere's "Best Agricultural Innovation" challenge.

# What Does Farmer's Marketplace do?
Farmers are by far one of the most significant jobs in our society; their efforts provide food for everyone. While average consumers have the luxury of conviniently purchasing almost anything they desire through e-commerce stores such as Amazon and Ebay, farmers lack a dependable means to obtain products that are vital for their occupation. When farmers need to buy seeds to grow their crops or need to quickly replace their broken tractor, there may be issues that disable them from easily getting those necessary goods, either due to supply shortages or cost. Therefore, we have created Farmer's Marketplace, an e-commerce platform specifically tailored towards farmers for them to purchase and sell farming goods to other farmers.
